# miniRT

 #### This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing.

"When it comes to rendering 3-dimensional computer-generated images there are 2 possible approaches: “Rasterization”, which is used by almost all graphic engines because
of its efficiency and “Ray Tracing.”
The “Ray Tracing” method, developed for the first time in 1968 (but improved upon
since) is even today more expensive in computation than the “Rasterization” method.
As a result, it is not yet fully adapted to real time use-cases but it produce a much higher
degree of visual realism."
